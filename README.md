## Task description:
In this studio you can:
  1. Generate your signal
  2. Add signals  
  3. Delete an added signal 
  4. Add/Delete noise
  5. Do sampling
  6. Save your signal in a CSV file
  7. Finally you can do all features above on an uploaded signal of your choice.


## Science behind the task:

Signal Sampling: Nyquist - Shannon Theorem

   A continuous-time (or analog) signal can be stored in a digital computer, in the form of equidistant discrete points or samples. The higher the sampling rate (or sampling frequency, fS), the more accurate would be the stored information and the signal reconstruction from its samples. However, a high sampling rate produces a large volume of data to be stored and makes necessary the use of a very fast analog-to-digital converter.

Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is stated as follows:

   A signal can be exactly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency component in the signal.
